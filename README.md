# Hello, I'm Mochammad Rizqi Aullia! ðŸ‘‹

You can call me Rizqi. I'm currently a 5th-semester student at Universitas Muhammadiyah Jakarta, pursuing my studies while also working as a gas filling operator. Alongside my studies and work, I am currently enrolled in the Bangkit Batch 7 program. This is my second time participating in such a program, as I previously completed a Full-Stack Developer bootcamp with HariSenin.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn: (https://www.linkedin.com/in/rizqiau/).
